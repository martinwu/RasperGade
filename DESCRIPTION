Description: RasperGade accounts for both time-independent variation and pulsed evolution by extending Felsenstein's recursive reconstruction method in ancestral and hidden state prediction. It can fit the pulsed evolution model given extant trait value and a phylogeny, reconstruct ancestral states or predict hidden states, and evaluate the quality of predicted ancestral and hidden states.
